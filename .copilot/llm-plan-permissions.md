# Plan: Permissions

## Introduction
Fix AI Hub storage access issue where the workspace cannot upload or access data due to permissions and networking configuration problems with the private storage account.

## Phase 1: Diagnosis and Analysis
- Task 1.1: Examine current bicep templates for missing role assignments
- Task 1.2: Analyze storage account networking configuration
- Task 1.3: Review AI Hub workspace identity requirements
- Task 1.4: Check private endpoint DNS resolution setup

## Phase 2: Role Assignment Implementation
- Task 2.1: Add Storage Blob Data Contributor role for AI Hub workspace identity
- Task 2.2: Add Storage File Data Contributor role for AI Hub workspace identity
- Task 2.3: Ensure proper scope and resource targeting for role assignments

## Phase 3: Network Configuration Enhancement
- Task 3.1: Verify private endpoint subnet configuration
- Task 3.2: Ensure proper DNS zone configuration for private endpoints
- Task 3.3: Add any missing network security configurations

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Task 4.1: Deploy updated bicep templates
- Task 4.2: Verify storage account accessibility from AI Hub
- Task 4.3: Test data upload and download functionality

## Implementation Status
**COMPLETED**: All code changes have been implemented to fix the storage access permissions issue.

**PENDING**: User has chosen not to proceed with deployment and testing at this time.

## Success Criteria (Pending Verification)
- AI Hub can successfully upload data to the storage account
- AI Hub can successfully access and download data from the storage account
- No permission errors when accessing the workspaceblobstore datastore
- Private endpoint networking functions correctly for AI Hub access

## What Was Accomplished
âœ… **Code Changes Complete**:
- Added Storage Blob Data Contributor and Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor role assignments for both AI Hub and AI Project identities
- Enhanced managed network configuration with outbound rules for private endpoint access
- All bicep templates updated and syntax validated

ðŸ“‹ **Ready for Deployment**: The bicep templates are ready to be deployed when you choose to proceed.

## Next Steps (When Ready)
When you're ready to test the fixes:
1. Deploy the updated bicep templates using the commands in the modifications summary
2. Test AI Hub storage access functionality
3. Verify the permission errors are resolved
