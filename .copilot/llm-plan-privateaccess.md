# Plan: Private Access

## Problem Analysis
The AI Hub cannot access the storage account because:
1. Storage account has `publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'` (correct for security)
2. Private endpoints exist but AI Hub is not configured to use them exclusively
3. AI Hub has `isolationMode: 'AllowInternetOutbound'` but storage is not accessible via internet
4. AI Hub needs managed network configuration to route through private endpoints

## Phase 1: Network Configuration Analysis
- Task 1.1: Analyze current AI Hub managed network settings
- Task 1.2: Review private endpoint configuration compatibility
- Task 1.3: Identify required changes for private endpoint routing

## Phase 2: AI Hub Managed Network Configuration
- Task 2.1: Change isolation mode to `AllowOnlyApprovedOutbound`
- Task 2.2: Configure AI Hub to use managed network with private endpoint access
- Task 2.3: Ensure storage account is referenced correctly in AI Hub properties

## Phase 3: Private Endpoint Integration
- Task 3.1: Verify private endpoint DNS configuration
- Task 3.2: Ensure AI Hub can resolve private endpoint addresses
- Task 3.3: Add any missing network outbound rules for private endpoints

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Task 4.1: Deploy updated configuration
- Task 4.2: Verify AI Hub can access storage via private endpoints
- Task 4.3: Test storage operations from AI Hub

- Storage account remains secured with public access disabled
- All AI Hub storage operations work correctly
- Network traffic from AI Hub to storage uses private backbone only
