# Plan: Outbound

## Problem Analysis
The deployment is failing with the error: "There is already an outbound rule to the same destination" for the storage account blob endpoint. This indicates a conflict between explicitly defined outbound rules and Azure ML's automatic rule creation.

## Phase 1: Investigation and Diagnosis
- Task 1.1: Examine current hub.bicep configuration for outbound rules
- Task 1.2: Research Azure ML Hub managed network behavior and automatic rule creation
- Task 1.3: Check if there are existing deployments that need cleanup

## Phase 2: Solution Implementation
- Task 2.1: Remove explicit outbound rules from hub.bicep to let Azure ML manage them automatically
- Task 2.2: Test deployment without explicit outbound rules
- Task 2.3: If needed, implement alternative approach for network configuration

## Phase 3: Validation
- Task 3.1: Deploy and verify successful deployment
- Task 3.2: Validate that storage connectivity works correctly
- Task 3.3: Document the solution and update configuration

## Checklist
- [x] Task 1.1: Examine current hub.bicep configuration for outbound rules
- [x] Task 1.2: Research Azure ML Hub managed network behavior and automatic rule creation
