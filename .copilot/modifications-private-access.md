# Modifications: Private Access

## Summary
Fixed AI Hub private endpoint access to storage account by updating managed network configuration and deployment dependencies.

## Problem
The AI Hub could not access the storage account because:
- Storage account has `publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'` (secure configuration)
- AI Hub was configured with `isolationMode: 'AllowInternetOutbound'`
- AI Hub was trying to access storage via public internet, which was blocked
- No configuration to route traffic through private endpoints

## Changes Made

### 1. AI Hub Managed Network Configuration (`hub.bicep`)
**Changed isolation mode** from `AllowInternetOutbound` to `AllowOnlyApprovedOutbound`:

```bicep
managedNetwork: {
  isolationMode: 'AllowOnlyApprovedOutbound'  // Changed from 'AllowInternetOutbound'
  status: {
    status: 'Active'
    sparkReady: false
  }
}
```

### 2. Deployment Dependencies (`main.bicep`)
**Added explicit dependency** to ensure networking resources are created before the hub:

```bicep
module hub 'hub.bicep' = {
  name: 'hub'
  params: {
    location: resourceGroup().location
    storageAccountId: storage.outputs.storageAccountId
  }
  dependsOn: [
    networking  // Added dependency
  ]
}
```

## How This Fixes the Issue

1. **Managed Network Isolation**: `AllowOnlyApprovedOutbound` mode ensures only approved connections are allowed
2. **Automatic Private Endpoint Rules**: Azure ML automatically creates outbound rules for attached storage accounts in approved mode
3. **Secure Traffic Routing**: All storage traffic from AI Hub now routes through private endpoints
4. **Proper Resource Order**: Networking resources are created before the hub to ensure proper connectivity

## Expected Behavior
- AI Hub will access storage account exclusively through private endpoints
- Storage account remains secure with public access disabled
- All traffic between AI Hub and storage uses Azure's private backbone
- No internet exposure for storage communications

## Deployment Instructions
Deploy using the existing script:
```bash
./infra/deploy.sh <location> <resource-group>
```

If you encounter conflicts from previous deployments, clean up first:
```bash
./infra/cleanup.sh <resource-group>
```

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Check AI Hub can access storage account
2. Verify no public internet access to storage
3. Test data upload/download operations
4. Confirm private endpoint connectivity in Azure portal
