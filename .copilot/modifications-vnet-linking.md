## Summary of Modifications

This document summarizes the changes made to the Bicep files to resolve the virtual network linking issue.

### `infra/storage_networking.bicep`

- **Re-enabled VNet Links**: Uncommented the `blobManagedPrivateDnsZoneVnetLink` and `fileManagedPrivateDnsZoneVnetLink` resources to resume the creation of virtual network links for the managed VNet.
- **Updated API Version**: Changed the API version for the `blobManagedPrivateDnsZoneVnetLink` and `fileManagedPrivateDnsZoneVnetLink` resources from `2020-06-01` to `2023-05-01` in an attempt to resolve the "invalid virtual network ID" error.
- **Removed Diagnostic Output**: Deleted the temporary `managedVnetId` output that was used for diagnostics.
